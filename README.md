**Fast MVC PHP** â€“ a powerful and lightning-fast solution for your web development needs.

Built from the ground up with performance in mind, our framework uses the latest techniques and technologies to ensure your website loads quickly and efficiently.

Our framework follows the **Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern**, making it easy to separate the different components of your application and maintain a clean and organized codebase.

With this custom templating engine, you can quickly create your html separated in components with layout functionality integrated. Plus, our templating system is optimized for speed, because it is using very simple raw php includes, so your website will load quickly and smoothly, even on slower connections.

In addition, our framework comes with a powerful ORM that makes it easy to work with your database. Whether you're working with MySQL, PostgreSQL, or another database system, our framework makes it easy to perform common tasks like querying, updating, and deleting data.

We've also included a robust routing system that allows you to easily map URLs to your application logic. This makes it easy to create RESTful APIs or build complex web applications with multiple pages and views.

And best of all, our framework is fully customizable, so you can tailor it to your specific needs. Whether you're building a simple blog or a complex web application, our framework can handle it all.
